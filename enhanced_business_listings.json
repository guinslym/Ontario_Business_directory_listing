They have 4-5 different lunch specials every day, and sandwich/soup specials.  \n\nTheir prices are quite competitive, (between $7-10 including tax) for lunch specials, which are usually Korean-inspired such as chicken terriyaki, stir fry, bulgogi, etc.\nI'm not quite sure what day, but they have cabbage rolls, with a choice of rice, mashed potatoes or vegetables.  You receive 2 cabbage rolls which are huge, stuffed with a large portion of ground beef.  They are the best cabbage rolls I have ever had with a nice tomato sauce, and the ground beef is not too peppery.  I think altogether it is either 7.33 or 7.90 (including tax).\n\nI am always full after eating here.  And unlike some of the other takeout places, they have multiple servers, so the line moves very quickly even if there are people in front of you.  So if you're in the area, this would be a great choice for lunch!  They have eat-in, but the furnishings are a bit antiquated.\""

I was wondering aimlessly around the streets of Toronto, starving and not finding something that would satisfy my appetite. I come across this cafe and craved for a sandwich all of a sudden. \n\nI didn't expect much from this establishment but they had quite the wide selection of choices to eat from. Lots of sandwiches, some come with a salad as a combo, homemade mac and cheese, pasta with meatballs... Wow I was a little overwhelmed with choices but one stuck out and I chose the grilled chicken sandwich. \n\nNow something that I've never heard of before, you get a minimum of 3 toppings and each extra topping is an added charge...hmm. I'm not a topping Queen or anything, just a simple lettuce and tomato girl but I don't think that's very fair. \n\nI also tried the homemade mac and cheese which completely turned my stomach off. I'm more of a KD girl myself but that stuff was...not anything I've ever had. At least the salad that came with it was decent, heavy on the sauce but nothing too terrible.\n\nAll in all it's a decent place to stop in for a quick bite, the grilled chicken sandwich was phenomenal but it could've been my hunger speaking. And it's a little bit pricey as I paid $6.99 for 2 pieces of toast, grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato, mayo and alfalfa sprouts. While the mac and cheese was a large portion, with a salad, I don't know if I would pay $7.49 for it.\""

This is a small tucked-away hair stylist in the downtown core with a small sandwich board and placard are all that tells you this little unassuming hair salon exists.  I used to work in the building that houses it and got to know Vicki through successive visits to her place.\n\nAdmittedly, when I visit she does not have much to work with, so our visits are spaced about two-to-three months apart.  That said, we catch up like old friends and she has a steadily growing client list.  I've noticed in times when I'm waiting for my turn in the chair that she treats everyone with the same respect and the same quality work.  She's also one of the few barbers I've seen that use a warming machine for the shaving cream when it comes time for the sideburns and nape of the neck.\n\nFantastic work and definitely reasonably priced.  I find it hard to go elsewhere.\""
