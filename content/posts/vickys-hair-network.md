description = "2 reviews of Vicky's Hair Network - CLOSED "Yes, even baldies like me need a haircut at some point.  This is a small tucked-away hair stylist in the downtown core with a small sandwich board and placard are all that tells you this little unassuming hair salon exists.  I used to work in the building that houses it and got to know Vicki through successive visits to her place.

Admittedly, when I visit she does not have much to work with, so our visits are spaced about two-to-three months apart.  That said, we catch up like old friends and she has a steadily growing client list.  I've noticed in times when I'm waiting for my turn in the chair that she treats everyone with the same respect and the same quality work.  She's also one of the few barbers I've seen that use a warming machine for the shaving cream when it comes time for the sideburns and nape of the neck.

Fantastic work and definitely reasonably priced.  I find it hard to go elsewhere.""
