I was wondering aimlessly around the streets of Toronto, starving and not finding something that would satisfy my appetite. I come across this cafe and craved for a sandwich all of a sudden. 

I didn't expect much from this establishment but they had quite the wide selection of choices to eat from. Lots of sandwiches, some come with a salad as a combo, homemade mac and cheese, pasta with meatballs... Wow I was a little overwhelmed with choices but one stuck out and I chose the grilled chicken sandwich. 

Now something that I've never heard of before, you get a minimum of 3 toppings and each extra topping is an added charge...hmm. I'm not a topping Queen or anything, just a simple lettuce and tomato girl but I don't think that's very fair. 

I also tried the homemade mac and cheese which completely turned my stomach off. I'm more of a KD girl myself but that stuff was...not anything I've ever had. At least the salad that came with it was decent, heavy on the sauce but nothing too terrible.

All in all it's a decent place to stop in for a quick bite, the grilled chicken sandwich was phenomenal but it could've been my hunger speaking. And it's a little bit pricey as I paid $6.99 for 2 pieces of toast, grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato, mayo and alfalfa sprouts. While the mac and cheese was a large portion, with a salad, I don't know if I would pay $7.49 for it.""
