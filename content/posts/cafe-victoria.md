description = "Delivery & Pickup Options - 6 reviews of Cafe Victoria - CLOSED -I often visit Cafe Victoria at least 1-2 times a week for lunch.  They have 4-5 different lunch specials every day, and sandwich/soup specials.  Their prices are quite competitive, (between $7-10 including tax) for lunch specials, which are usually Korean-inspired such as chicken terriyaki, stir fry, bulgogi, etc. I'm not quite sure what day, but they have cabbage rolls, with a choice of rice, mashed potatoes or vegetables.  You receive 2 cabbage rolls which are huge, stuffed with a large portion of ground beef.  They are the best cabbage rolls I have ever had with a nice tomato sauce, and the ground beef is not too peppery.  I think altogether it is either 7.33 or 7.90 (including tax). I am always full after eating here.  And unlike some of the other takeout places, they have multiple servers, so the line moves very quickly even if there are people in front of you.  So if you're in the area, this would be a great choice for lunch!  They have eat-in, but the furnishings are a bit antiquated."
